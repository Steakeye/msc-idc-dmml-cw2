#Task 2: Formation of Training and Test Sets

##Premise

>Assuming we have collected one large dataset of already-classified instances, you need to look at three methods
of forming training and test sets from this single dataset in R as described below.
>• The holdout method
>• Cross-validation
>• Leave-one-out cross-validation (Jack Knife)

##Holdout dataset 


```{r test}
head(abalone_data_cleansed)
```


<!--
Formation of training and test sets from in R using the methods below.
• The holdout method 5
• Cross-validation 5
• Leave-one-out cross-validation (Jack Knife) 5
-->
